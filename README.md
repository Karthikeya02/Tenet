### *The Plot*
After having a near-death experience, an unnamed CIA operative, known as the Protagonist, is selected to join the ranks of the shadowy government organization called Tenet: a group tasked with ensuring the survival of the human race. Entrusted with coming to grips with a terrifying, cutting-edge technology, and an imminent attack from the future, the Protagonist teams up with his cryptic new partner, Neil, following a faint trail of clues that lead to the villainous Russian oligarch, Sator. However, this is a race against time, and as the suffocating stranglehold of the invisible threat tightens, more and more, the future of our world is hanging by a thread. Can two agents working alone avert the impending Armageddon?

### *Scientific Accuracy*
The film's plot revolves around reversing the entropy of things and people, resulting in time reversibility. Tenet makes reference to physics concepts including annihilation,the second law of thermodynamics, Maxwell's demon, and Feynman and Wheeler's notion of a  one-electron universe,but Christopher Nolan stated in the film's press notes: "we‚Äôre not going to make any case for this being scientifically accurate‚Äù.
